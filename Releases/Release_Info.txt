OFFICIAL RELEASE ARTIFACTS

This folder serves as a reference for official project releases.

In accordance with Software Configuration Management (SCM) best practices,
large source code archives and release packages are not stored directly
inside the repository. Instead, official releases are managed using
GitHub’s built-in "Releases" feature to maintain a clean and lightweight repository.

The officially packaged source code archives for this project can be found here:
https://github.com/NiyatHannibal/Campus-Lost-and-Found-System/releases
